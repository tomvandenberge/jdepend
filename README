This is a fork of clarkware/jdepend. 

It few features have been added, and things have been improved:

 * DependencyConstraint has been split up to DependencyPrescription and DependencyProscription
 * The pre/proscriptions can be used to verify a subset of the analysed classes, instead of all, using a package filter
 * The project can also be built with maven
 * A start has been made to introduce generics in the code
 * Test cases have been fixed

  What Is It? 
  -----------
  
  JDepend traverses Java class and source file directories and 
  generates design quality metrics for each Java package. JDepend allows 
  you to automatically measure the quality of a design in terms of its 
  extensibility, reusability, and maintainability to effectively manage 
  and control package dependencies.
